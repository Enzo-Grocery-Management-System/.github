# Enzo :fork_and_knife:

#### Enzo is a revolutionary grocery management system that helps people reduce food waste by planning weekly meals based on their preferences. Enzo creates a grocery list for you, tells you which groceries you need to buy at the store and keeps tracks of what items you used while cooking.

##### Enzoâ€™s main goal is to proactively assist families and individuals to reduce their food waste while making sure their groceries are used when making different kinds of recipes.

##### The application is currently under its research and development phase, which means that the MVP is under scrutiny for possible improvements. We are ensuring a smooth SDLC. However, the research keeps challenging our requirements, having to have to flexibly adapt new features.

##### It is yet undecided whether Enzo should go open source. We are considering the option!:earth_americas:
